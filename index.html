<br>   <h1><strong> The Manarat Cove Education Center</strong></h1>
<p>
<big>Welcome to the Manarat Cove Education Center, a small side-project created by a group of crafty students with the purpose of making studying much easier for everyone. Resources sent from the school such as study guides and past papers are collected and neatly stored here for use by other students. We also have an array of our own in-house question papers and summary sheets for the many topics that are in the syllabus of the 9BR classes. With access to all this powerful information, studying should be much easier!</big>
  <br> <br>

       Check out our study resources from the top banner to get started with learning new topics. If you still need help, consider checking out our Discord server and get help from volunteer students.

       And, if you want to volunteer for a job yourself, go step right up! You'll be making someone's life a lot easier, and help reinforce your own knowledge.

    <h1><strong>What is our goal?</strong></h1>
      
    <p>
       The Manarat Cove Education Center's primary goal is to allow students to get the education that they deserve. Long gone are the days of not understanding a certain topic and having nobody to ask about it to. With this powerful website, all you need to do is dig up one of our articles about something in the course, and you'll be understanding it for sure in no time! If you still can't figure it out, don't fret, we are here to help! Check out our Discord server if you need more help with a certain topic. This website was created for the sole purpose of helping other students catch up with work, so that nobody is left behind. It's okay to not understand everything in one go, but with resources like this, you should be finishing up in a breeze.

<h1><strong>What can you use this site for?</strong>
  </h1>    
  <p>This site can be used for a variety of purposes relating to your academics curriculum. While this site is mostly intended to be used for Manarat students studying in the British Stream of Grade 9 "9BR", it can also be used by students studying in the American stream as there are some similar topics. It can even be used by students studying in Grade 8 for extended practice and insight on what is to come. Any student can access our study material from the top bar above for absolutely free, and gain access to a multitude of education resources ranging from quick questions to detailed descriptions on any given topic in the 9BR course. As the years go on, we will archive these existing courses and put forth newer topics for higher grade levels, such as Grade 10 and 11. Existing data has already been archived, so we have access to a few topics from Grade 8 as well. Our library at the moment does mostly consist of Grade 9 topics. Any additional information is on our Discord Server.
